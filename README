******************** OR FrameWork in C++ *********************************
Before using this framework you have to installed MySql

and c++ connectivity with Mysql.

First of all you have to find attached folder OR-Mapping.

In this folder you will get all the .cpp and xml file for mapping.

	At first stage you have to define xml files for your .cpp files as show in all xml files in the folder.This all are case-sensitive so you have to follow all the basic rule as wrote in the xml files for all constraints and all mapping(one-to-one , many-to-many , one-to-many and many-to-one).

	After creating all the xml files for your .cpp , create all .cpp files for your xml files(remember all the you define in your xml files must be same in the .cpp files) and include two header file first is Session.h and another one is the Sessionfactory.h.

	Then follow all code like wrote all .cpp files in the floder (you will find every .cpp examples for the mapping).

	If you gets problem then you can ask me through mail on siddhesh.dosi@iiitb.org.
